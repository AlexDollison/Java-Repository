# Java-Repository

# -Client's name is "The Gaming Room," the requirement for the software was to develop a web-based game that would be available on multiple platforms, called Draw it or Lose it. They originally developed it for the Android, but wanted the game to be available on more platforms.

# -My organization of the project was some of the best work I have done, and is very easy to read even on some of the more dense parts of the project.

# -Using a design document made it very easy to categorize both my thoughts and the project itself, and developing the code in pieces was easier to work with and debug.

# -The "Domain Model" portion of the document could use some refining, as well as more use of whitespace to make particular parts of the design a little more clear.

# -The user needed a way to transfer the game they had already designed to multiple new platforms, without losing the capabilities they had already built upon. By listing several ways to help fix their problems and how to implement these changes, I was able to give the client ideas that they could take or leave without interfering with their program. It's important to take a client's needs into consideration, as they are not only paying you, but they are trusting you with their product in hopes you can improve it in a way that satisfies them. If you are designing something for a client, their needs matter the most, and you must work without the bounds provided and provide reasonable results, assuming the client's desires aren't beyond your abilities.

# -My approach to designing software was working piece by piece and considering all facets of the program before providing any particular answer, and rather than providing one solution, I provided an array of solutions and options that the client could choose from. Even if I recommend one method over another, the client's needs may call for something different. Rather than making a choice for the customer, providing them with options and seeing what they like provides better results.
